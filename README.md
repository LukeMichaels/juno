# Juno
A WordPress starter theme, also a chihuahua living in Portland OR.  

This theme was built using:  
  - [html5blank](http://html5blank.com/)
  - [Sass Boilerplate](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate)

## Note: This project is a work-and-progress and IS NOT ready for use yet. I'm still working on some key components (such as the Grunt file and instructions on how to get started developing)
