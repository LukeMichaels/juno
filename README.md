# Juno
A WordPress starter theme, also a chihuahua living in Portland OR.  

### Note: This project is a work-and-progress and IS NOT ready for use yet. I'm still working on some key components (such as the Grunt file and instructions on how to get started developing)

This theme is inspired by and borrows from:  
  - [html5blank](http://html5blank.com/)
  - [Sass Boilerplate](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/sass-boilerplate)

## Installation
  - Pull down all of the files into your projects `themes` folder
  - cd into the `juno` folder and run `npm-install`
  - run `grunt`

## What's in the box?
  - Sass
  - Grunt
  - Normalize
  - Modernizr
  - Conditionizr
  - jQuery

## License
The WTFPL is a very permissive license for software and other scientific or artistic works that offers a great degree of freedom. In fact, it is probably the best license out there. [This site provides information on how to make the most of the WTFPL.](http://www.wtfpl.net)
